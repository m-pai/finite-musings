# Division Algorithm.

**THEOREM.** _Division Algorithm_
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $b>0$. Then there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ with the property that $a=bq+r$, where $0\leq r < b$.

> For proof: Prove existence, then prove that $r$ has to be less than $b$, and finally prove uniqueness.
